Title: Mean and Covariance Matrix Estimation under Heavy Tails
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Date: 2019-09-23
Description: Estimation of mean vector and covariance matrix for heavy-tailed 
    distributions. In particular, a multivariate Student t distribution is 
    fitted to the data. Special emphasis is placed on a fast implementation.
    The package is based on the paper:
    Rui ZHOU, Junyan Liu, Sandeep Kumar, and Daniel P. Palomar, "Robust factor 
    analysis parameter estimation," Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2020.
