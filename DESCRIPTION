Title: Mean and Covariance Matrix Estimation under Heavy Tails
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Date: 2019-11-15
Description: Estimation of mean vector and covariance matrix for a multivariate 
    heavy-tailed Student's t distribution from data (possibly containing NAs).
    Additionally, a factor model structure can be specified for the covariance 
    matrix.
    The package is based on the paper:
    Rui ZHOU, Junyan Liu, Sandeep Kumar, and Daniel P. Palomar, "Robust factor 
    analysis parameter estimation," Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2019.
