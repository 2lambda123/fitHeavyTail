Title: Mean and Covariance Matrix Estimation under Heavy Tails
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 2019-11-16
Description: Robust estimation methods for the mean vector and covariance matrix 
    from data (possibly containing NAs) under multivariate heavy-tailed 
    distributions such as angular Gaussian, Cauchy, and Student's t. Additionally,
    a factor model structure can be specified for the covariance matrix.
