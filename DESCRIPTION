Title: Mean and Covariance Matrix Estimation under Heavy Tails
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Date: 2019-11-15
Description: Robust estimation of mean vector and covariance matrix from data 
    (possibly containing NAs) under a multivariate heavy-tailed Student's t 
    distribution. Additionally, a factor model structure can be specified for 
    the covariance matrix.
    The package is based on the paper:
    Rui Zhou, Junyan Liu, Sandeep Kumar, and Daniel P. Palomar, "Robust factor 
    analysis parameter estimation," Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), 2019.
